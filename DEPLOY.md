# 🚀 Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the portfolio to GitHub Pages.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Repository**: Ensure your code is pushed to GitHub
2. **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher installed locally
3. **GitHub Pages**: Must be enabled in repository settings

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
4. Save the settings

### 2. Configure Repository Secrets (Optional)

If you need environment variables:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Add any required secrets

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd React/my-portfolio-chat
npm install
```

## 🚀 Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

The portfolio will automatically deploy when you push changes to the `main` branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update portfolio"
git push origin main
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will:

1. ✅ Build the React application
2. ✅ Run tests (if configured)
3. ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages
4. ✅ Update live site

### Method 2: Manual Deployment

If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
cd React/my-portfolio-chat
npm run deploy
```

This will:

1. Build the production version
2. Deploy to `gh-pages` branch
3. Update the live site

## 🔍 Monitoring Deployment

### Check Deployment Status

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Monitor the **"Deploy Portfolio to GitHub Pages"** workflow
3. Green checkmark = successful deployment
4. Red X = deployment failed (check logs)

### View Live Site

Once deployed, visit: `https://keeplay20.github.io/tech-practice-hub`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Failures:**

```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

**Routing Issues:**

- GitHub Pages doesn't support client-side routing by default
- The portfolio uses hash routing for compatibility

**Asset Loading Issues:**

- Ensure `homepage` field in `package.json` is correct
- Check relative paths in imports

### Checking Logs

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on the failed workflow
3. Expand the failing step to see detailed logs

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### Package.json Settings

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://keeplay20.github.io/tech-practice-hub",
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
  }
}
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Located at: `.github/workflows/deploy-portfolio.yml`

## 📱 Testing Deployment

### Local Testing

```bash
# Build and serve locally
npm run build
npx serve -s build
```

### Production Testing

1. Test all game functionality
2. Verify responsive design
3. Check all navigation links
4. Test form submissions (if any)

## 🔄 Updating the Portfolio

To update your live portfolio:

1. **Make changes** to your React code
2. **Test locally** with `npm start`
3. **Commit and push** to GitHub
4. **Wait for deployment** (usually 2-3 minutes)
5. **Verify live site** is updated

## 📊 Performance Optimization

The build process automatically:

- ✅ Minifies JavaScript and CSS
- ✅ Optimizes images
- ✅ Generates service worker for caching
- ✅ Creates optimized production build

## 🎯 Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. 🔗 Share your portfolio URL
2. 📈 Monitor site analytics (optional)
3. 🔄 Keep content updated
4. 📱 Test on various devices
